INTRODUCTION
======================================================================================================================
Use this PHP class to create a monthly calendar. It's easy to use and highly customizable, supports multiple
languages, and you can choose whether weeks start with Saturday, Sunday, Monday, or any other day. Of course you
can create as many calendars as you like.

In 1582, Gregory XIII made a calendar reformation (advanced leap year rules + 10 days have been dropped in October)
and created the Gregorian calendar, which is in use since then. Therefore HTML-Calendar applies the Gregorian
calendar for years > 1582, and the old Julian calendar for years <= 1582.

USAGE
======================================================================================================================
Include the CALENDAR class into your PHP script and create a new instance:

  include("calendar.inc.php");
  $myCal = new CALENDAR();       	    // view current month

If you don't want to view the current month, you can set year and month like this:

  $myCal = new CALENDAR(2004, 12);          // view December 2004
  $myCal = new CALENDAR(2004);              // view January 2004

You can also set year and month by using the according properties:

  $myCal = new CALENDAR();
  $myCal->year = 2004;
  $myCal->month = 12;

NOTE: I'm using my own functions to calculate the dates. Thus the calendar range is from year 1 to year 3999 and
not affected by any PHP or operating system restrictions. Also note that this script applies both, the Gregorian
and the Julian calendar, so it can be used to view historically correct dates.

Adapt the configuration to your needs:

  $myCal->tFontFace = "Comic Sans MS";      // change font face for title (month)
  $myCal->hFontSize = 3;                    // change font size for heading (weekdays)
  $myCal->dFontColor = "#808080";           // change font color for days
  $myCal->offset = 2;                       // start week with Monday
  $myCal->link = "path/to/my/page.php";     // set page to link to when day is clicked
  ...

Use the function viewEvent() to add events to the calendar. It takes the following arguments:

  viewEvent(start day, end day, color, title, [link])

Example:

  // view seminar "How to use HTML-Calendar" from 6th to 8th with color #E0E0FF
  $myCal->viewEvent(6, 8, "#E0E0FF", "Seminar &quot;How to use HTML-Calendar&quot;");

  // view trip to Hawaii from 15th to 19th with color #D0FFD0 and link
  $myCal->viewEvent(15, 19, "#D0FFD0", "Trip to Hawaii!", "/trips/hawaii/index.php");

Finally create the calendar:

  echo $myCal->create();
